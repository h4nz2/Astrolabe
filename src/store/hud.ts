/**
 * The quiet interface (#42; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "HUD layout"): the state of
 * the solar system's HUD itself, not of the scene.
 *
 * - `panel`: the dock's own panels (Layers, Scale, the spacecraft list). The
 *   tools with a store of their own (light, birthday, sky tonight, hunt) keep
 *   their `open` flag there; `features/solarSystem/dock/exclusive.ts` keeps
 *   every docked panel, of either kind, to one at a time.
 * - `cardExpanded`: the body card shows its full facts. It starts small (name
 *   and one sentence) and keeps the viewer's choice while the page is open.
 * - `cardClosedFor`: the body whose card the viewer closed; the camera stays
 *   put and the card stays away until another body is focused or selected.
 * - `cameraMoving`: the camera is being dragged, zoomed or flown right now;
 *   the secondary controls dim meanwhile (`camera/motion.ts` writes it).
 *
 * Nothing here is in the URL: a link names a view, not how the controls sit.
