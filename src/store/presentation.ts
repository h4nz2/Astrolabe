/**
 * Teacher and presentation mode (#29; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Presentation").
 *
 * - `presenting`: projector mode, large type and big hit targets. In the URL
 *   as `present=true`, so a prepared lesson link opens ready for the projector.
 * - `highContrast`: solid panels and brighter text for washed-out projectors.
 *   In the URL as `contrast=high`; a viewer's `prefers-contrast: more` turns it
 *   on as well (see `features/solarSystem/present/usePresentationDocument.ts`).
 * - `chromeHidden`: every HUD panel hidden, just the solar system. Never in the
 *   URL: a link must never open without its way back.
 * - `startSearch`: the link the page was opened with, the "start of the
 *   lesson" that `R` / Home restore (`present/restoreStart.ts`).
 * - `announcement`: the last keyboard action, read out by the live region.
 *
 * Per-frame code reads it with `usePresentationStore.getState()`; the HUD
 * subscribes through selectors.
